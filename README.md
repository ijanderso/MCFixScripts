# Various scripts to fix MC

## Add lepton masses:
Requires a ROOT installation to run.

This script was written specifically to add lepton masses to the PHANTOM generator for a ZZ decay to electrons/muons. Using the pair of leptons from a Z, a portion of the second lepton is added to the first (and vice versa) such that the resultant 4-momenta have the correct lepton masses and that total momenta of the Z is conserved. _NOTE: Currently, any other generator or process could use this but the code would need considerable tweaking to work properly._

To use, point leptonmassfixDir.sh to the directory containing the LHE files to be altered. This will change ALL LHE files in said directory.

	chmod +x leptonmassfixDir.sh
	./leptonmassfixDir.sh <Directory of LHE files>

## Add lifetime to particles:
Requires a ROOT installation to run.

This script was written to add lifetimes to particles in generated LHE files. A random value from the exponential function is thrown on an event by event basis. This has been confirmed to interface with PYTHIA6 to displace vertices. _NOTE: Currently, the code is written to deal with either POWHEG or POWHEG+JHUGen generators and the Higgs. With small modifications, any generated particle could be given a proper lifetime. Further, it is expected that this will work with PYTHIA8 but it has not been tested._

To use, point lifetimefixDir.sh to the directory containing the LHE files to be altered. This will change ALL LHE files in said directory. 

	chmod +x lifetimefixDir.sh
	./lifetimefixDir.sh <Directory of LHE files> <Proper lifetime in Âµm>
